# Optimizing-Unmanned-Hotels-Using-Gesture-Recognition
This is my 2022-2023 Final Year Project at City University of Hong Kong.

# Project Goal
The project aims to address the challenges faced by traditional hotel operations during public health crises, such as the recent epidemic. And to solve by leveraging non-contact gesture recognition technology. Also, with the Hong Kong government's "Hong Kong Smart City Blueprint" and its goal of creating a "Smart City 2.0". The project incorporates various components, including an online booking website for unmanned hotels, a simulated check-in process using public machines, and gesture authentication for unlocking room doors. To achieve this, I utilized PHP and Python programming languages. PHP was employed for website development and backend functions like database management, while Python was primarily used for training deep neural network model to detect gesture authentication. Overall, the project aims to optimize unmanned hotels through the implementation of gesture recognition technology and thereby improve traditional hotel business operations.
