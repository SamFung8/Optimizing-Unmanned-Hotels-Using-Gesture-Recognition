# Optimizing-Unmanned-Hotels-Using-Gesture-Recognition
This is my 2022-2023 Final Year Project at City University of Hong Kong.

# Project Goal
This project aims to optimize the operation process of the current unmanned hotel using gesture recognition. Try to find another innovative technology, not only to replace the current traditional method to control the public machines, but also to achieve gesture authentication to solve the traditional problem of needing to touch the door handle or use keycard to open the door. Using detect your hand or finger in a specific way in front of the webcam to tell the machine what action needs to be done and user identity verification.
